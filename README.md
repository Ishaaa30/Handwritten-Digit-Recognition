# Handwritten Digit Recognition  

## Overview  
This is a web-based Handwritten Digit Recognition system that allows users to draw digits (0–9) on a canvas and predicts them using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and can improve over time through user feedback.  

## Features  
- **Digit Prediction**: Users can draw digits (0–9) on a canvas, and the system predicts them in real time.  
- **Correction & Learning**: Users can correct wrong predictions, and the model learns from them.  
- **Retraining Mechanism**: The model retrains itself dynamically using corrected images.  
- **Interactive Web UI**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas API) for smooth interaction.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes PyTorch and CNN for digit recognition.
